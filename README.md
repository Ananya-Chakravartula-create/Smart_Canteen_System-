# Smart_Canteen_System-
Project Overview:
Smart Canteen System is a web-based application designed to digitize and simplify the food ordering process in an office cafeteria.
It allows employees to register, log in, view the menu, place food orders online, and enables administrators to monitor all orders efficiently.

The system reduces waiting time, avoids manual order handling, and improves overall canteen management.
